# metis-EDA

I've tried my best to read up on how to do EDA. Unfortunately, I don't know how to import CSV file onto Jupyter Notebook online version and I do not know a Python environment to run the file on. 

These are codes that I wrote to the best of my ability to visualize the data without a platform.
